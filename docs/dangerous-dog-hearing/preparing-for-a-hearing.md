# Preparing for a Hearing

You have been summoned to a ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearing because you have been identified as a person claiming that they or their animal was injured (complaining witness), as a witness, or as an owner of an animal accused of biting, attacking, or injuring, a human or another animal (respondent). This web page includes important information you should know to prepare effectively for your hearing.
## Clear your calendar
Make sure you are able to attend your hearing. Failing to show up has consequences for you and your case. If you cannot attend the hearing for any reason, please contact the Hearings Division well before the hearing. Contact the Hearings Division via email at ani.hearings@lacity.org or by phone at (213) 482-7435 to let them know if you have concerns over your ability to attend your hearing, and they will determine if there is good cause to reschedule. You must inform them of your case number, which appears on your summons.

-	For respondent: If you do not attend the hearing, you lose your right to appeal the Department’s determination in your case. You also forfeit your opportunity to testify on the record to give your side of the story, which would help the Hearing Examiner identify the appropriate resolution for your case. This often leads to a worse outcome from the hearing than if you had attended it. Particularly, if you do not attend the hearing, the Hearing Examiner cannot show in their report that you would be willing to comply with terms and conditions. Accordingly, your license to own a particular dog could be revoked. If that happens, you will be prohibited from owning any dog in the City of Los Angeles for three years. See Outcomes of Potentially Dangerous Animal Administrative Hearings to learn more about the possible outcomes.
-	For person claiming injury to self or their animals (complaining witness): If you do not attend the hearing, the Department may dismiss your case if there is not enough evidence to support the allegations in your initial complaint. There may be sufficient admissible evidence in the file, but, if not, your failure to attend will result in dismissal of the case. The hearing is your best opportunity to explain what happened and what you think the appropriate resolution should be.  
-	For other witnesses to an alleged incident: Your testimony provides information that may help the Hearing Examiner determine what happened and what the appropriate outcome should be. It is important that you attend to allow the Department to get the fullest picture of what happened so it may determine what the appropriate outcome should be. Witness statements by persons not in attendance at the hearing generally cannot be afforded any weight in the Hearing Examiner’s recommendation unless they are made under penalty of perjury. A written or video recorded statement may be considered if submitted under penalty of perjury. Please see Submitting Evidence for an Administrative Hearing for more information about how to submit relevant evidence under penalty of perjury. 

Again, if you have an emergency that keeps you from attending the hearing at the date and time scheduled, you must notify the Hearings Division as soon as possible. Contact the Hearings Division via email at ani.hearings@lacity.org or call (213) 482-7435. You must provide the case number, which appears on your summons. You will not receive another opportunity to be heard if you attempt to reschedule after the Hearing Examiner has closed the hearing. 

## Understand the purpose of the hearing
A ‘potentially dangerous animal’ hearing stems from the investigation conducted by the Department of Animal Services (LAAS) after a complaining witness has reports a potential violation of the Los Angeles Municipal Code ‘potentially dangerous animal’ statute, § 53.34.4. A District requests the Department’s Hearings Division conduct a hearing to determine whether an animal poses an unreasonable risk to public safety. At the hearing, the Hearing Examiner will gather evidence and hear testimony, submitted under oath, relevant to the complaint so he or she can recommend an appropriate resolution to the case to the General Manager of LAAS. The General Manager decides the ultimate outcome of the case. The hearing is meant to provide procedural protections to ensure the Department orders the proper outcome to best protect public safety.

## Be aware of the possible outcomes
There are four possible outcomes of a ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearing:

(1)	Dismissal. If there is not enough evidence to determine that a bite, attack, or injury occurred, the case will be dismissed. The case may also be dismissed if a bite, attack, or injury did occur, but it is determined that the animal does not pose a risk to public safety. 
(2)	Reissuance of license with terms, conditions, and restrictions. If the evidence shows that a bite, attack, or injury occurred, but that the severity of the incident does not warrant declaring the animal ‘dangerous,’ the Department may reissue the Respondent’s license subject to reasonable terms, conditions, and restrictions (TCRs). This happens when the Department believes that imposing TCRs will eliminate the unreasonable risk to public safety. TCRs are conditions of animal ownership placed on a license and are intended to prevent the recurrence of the circumstances that led to an incident resulting in an administrative hearing. The respondent must demonstrate that they are willing and able to comply with reasonable TCRs. TCRs may include verification procedures by the Department.  For more information on potential TCRs, read Terms, Conditions, and Restrictions (TCRs). 
(3)	License revocation. If the evidence shows that a bite, attack, or injury occurred and that the respondent is unwilling or unable to take protective measures (in the form of TCRs) that will adequately protect public safety, the respondent’s license for animal ownership will be revoked. A revoked license means the respondent may not own any animals requiring a license in the city of Los Angeles for 3 years from the date of revocation. The respondent will receive an order to either promptly and permanently remove their animals from the City of Los Angeles or to relinquish their animals to the Department. 
(4)	Animal declared dangerous and destroyed. If the evidence shows that a bite, attack, or injury occurred and the consequences are so severe that the Department believes the animal cannot be maintained safely either inside or outside of the City of Los Angeles without being an unreasonable threat to public safety, the animal will be declared dangerous and humanely destroyed. Note, the Department believes in facilitating responsible animal ownership, and this outcome occurs only if other possible avenues are foreclosed by a determination that the animal cannot be safely maintained anywhere. The Department strives to maintain the City of Los Angeles as a no-kill jurisdiction. For more information on the Department’s no-kill philosophy, see Defining No-Kill for the City of Los Angeles.

For more information on what each of these outcomes means for you, see Outcomes of Potentially Dangerous Animal Administrative Hearings. 

## Arrange for an interpreter
All hearings are conducted in English. If English is not your native language, you may feel more comfortable having a translator present at the hearing. At this time, the Department is not able to provide translators for ’potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearings. If you would like to have a translator, you will have to provide your own. The translator can be a friend or family member. However, they should not be your legal representative or a party or witness at the administrative hearing. Their only role is to translate. Translators must be able to translate all statements as they are stated, without inserting any bias or their own additional interpretation into their translation. More information for translators is accessible here.

## Consider consulting with a lawyer
Attorneys are neither required nor expected at administrative hearings conducted by the Department. However, some participants do choose to hire an attorney, and the attorney is most welcome to attend and participate in the hearing. The opportunity for appeal is limited in administrative hearings conducted by the Department, so it is important that you are prepared to properly present evidence and argue your case at the hearing. Especially in complicated matters, if injuries are severe, or there have been multiple incidents, it may be a good idea to consult with an attorney. More information for attorneys is available here.

## Study Exhibit 1
Exhibit 1 contains the investigation record with respect to the complaint that led to the administrative hearing. You should have received a copy of Exhibit 1 when you received your summons. If you did not receive a copy of Exhibit 1, contact the Hearings Division as soon as possible and they will provide one to you. You can request a copy of Exhibit 1 by emailing ani.hearings@lacity.org. You must provide the case number, which appears on your summons.

It is important that you review the information contained in Exhibit 1 as it is a part of the record for the administrative hearing. The Hearing Examiner will rely on Exhibit 1 to evaluate the incident that led to the administrative hearing and will ask questions about it at the hearing. Your familiarity with Exhibit 1 will allow you to participate most fully in the hearing. At the hearing, you can ask questions to clarify the record in Exhibit 1 and provide further evidence to support your case. 

Prior to the hearing, you can supplement the record contained in Exhibit 1 by submitting additional evidence to the District that requested the administrative hearing. See ‘Instructions for submitting evidence’ below. Please note that all evidence, whether written or oral, must be submitted under penalty of perjury. The penalty for perjury in California is a fine of up to $10,000 and up to four years in county jail. (PC § 118). The penalty for preparing and/or submitting false evidence under oath in California is a fine of up to $10,000 and up to three years in state prison. (PC § 132, PC § 134).	

## Gather your evidence
The Department must consider the 11 statutory factors listed in LAMC § 53.34.4(c) when determining the outcome of a case. The Hearing Examiner will consider any evidence that is credible and relevant to these factors when writing their report and recommendation to the General Manager. For more information about evidence that may be considered at a hearing, see Evidence at ‘Potentially Dangerous Animal’ Administrative Hearings. 

### Understand the 11 statutory factors

These are the factors that the Department must consider in determining the outcome of a potentially dangerous animal administrative hearing: 
(1)	Any previous history of the animal biting, attacking, or causing injury to a human being or other animal;
(2)	The nature and extent of injuries inflicted, and the number of victims involved;
(3)	The place where the bite, attack, or injury occurred;
(4)	The presence or absence of any provocation for the bite, attack, or injury;
(5)	The extent to which property has been damaged or destroyed;
(6)	Whether the animal exhibits characteristics of being trained for fighting or attack, or other evidence to show such training or fighting;
(7)	Whether the animal exhibits characteristics of aggressive or unpredictable temperament or behavior in the presence of human beings or other animals;
(8)	Whether the animal can be effectively trained or retrained to change its temperament or behavior;
(9)	The manner in which the animal had been maintained by its owner or custodian;
(10)	Any other relevant evidence considering the maintenance of the animal; and
(11)	Any other relevant evidence regarding the ability of the owner or custodian, or the Department, to protect the public safety in the future if the animal is permitted to remain in the city of Los Angeles.

Not every factor will be relevant to every case. The extent to which a given factor is relevant to the outcome depends on the circumstances of the case and the evidence presented at the hearing. More information about what the Department is looking for and the type of evidence that is relevant to each factor is available at Evidence for ‘Potentially Dangerous Animal’ Administrative Hearings. Please note that evidence can be relevant to a decision regarding likelihood of respondent’s compliance with terms, conditions, and restrictions, if any are under consideration. Only credible, relevant information submitted under penalty of perjury will be considered. 

### Reliability and relevance of evidence considered. 
The Department will consider various types of evidence when deciding whether LAMC § 53.34.4 has been violated. To be considered, the evidence presented must be credible and relevant to the issues under consideration such that a reasonable person could and would rely on the evidence to make the required legal determination. Evidence can be presented in oral, written, video/audio recorded, or photographic form. Evidence that is credible and relevant as to one issue may or may not be relevant to another issue. Different pieces of evidence may be weighted differently in the Department’s decision based on their relevance and reliability, within the discretion of the Hearing Examiner.

### A note regarding written or recorded statements from individuals who will not be present at the hearing
Parties often want to provide letters, emails, or other statements relaying information such as an eyewitness account of the incident or animal character reference from people who are not present to testify at the hearing. However, these statements cannot be afforded any weight in the Hearing Examiner’s recommendation because (1) there is no way for the Hearing Examiner to verify the identity of the author of the statement and otherwise assess the credibility of the statement; and (2) the other parties do not have the opportunity to ask questions or challenge the evidence. Such statements may be afforded more weight if they are submitted in sworn declarations or affidavits made under penalty of perjury.

## Instructions for submitting evidence
You may submit additional evidence not contained in Exhibit 1 both prior to and during your administrative hearing. However, it is encouraged that parties submit their evidence prior to the hearing rather than at the hearing. Submitting evidence prior to the hearing allows the Hearing Examiner and Department Representative to better understand the circumstances of the case in preparation for the hearing so they can more effectively direct questioning on the record and reach the best result. Also, all parties must have an opportunity to see and challenge any evidence to be included in the record. Introducing new evidence remotely via Zoom poses challenges which may mean some evidence attempted to be presented at a hearing cannot be considered.
Evidence submitted prior to the hearing must be submitted under penalty of perjury no less than XX days prior to the hearing. Evidence may be submitted via email, mail, or in-person to the District that requested the administrative hearing. The requesting District is indicated in your summons via the letter code following the numeric digits in your case number. For example, WLA at the end of the fictitious case number DA 012345 WLA indicates the West Los Angeles District submitted the request for the hearing. The letter code for each District and contact information is available here. In your communications with the District, you must provide your case number, which is located on your summons. 

### A note regarding relying on evidence submitted prior to the hearing
While it is recommended that parties submit evidence prior to the hearing to help with the evidence gathering process, in general, it is not a good idea for either party to rely on evidence submitted prior to the hearing to be persuasive to the Hearing Examiner without also testifying to that evidence during the hearing to authenticate it. It is important that both parties still attend the hearing, despite submitting evidence beforehand, because the Hearing Examiner and other party must be able to ask questions about that evidence to aid in determining how much weight that evidence should be given. Exhibit 1 and other evidence submitted prior to the hearing is generally given less weight than it otherwise would have if the Hearing Examiner does not have an opportunity to ask the parties about it at the Hearing. Moreover, failure to attend the hearing means that you cannot respond to statements made at the hearing. It has other potentially serious consequences. The consequences of failing to attend a hearing are discussed at the beginning of this page under the heading explaining why you should ‘Clear Your Calendar.’
