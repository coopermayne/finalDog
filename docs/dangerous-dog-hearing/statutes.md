# Overview of Lamc § 53.34.4 Dangerous Animal – Procedures

LAMC § 53.34.4 Dangerous Animal – Procedures (link to statute)

An animal may be declared dangerous if the Department determines it has bitten, attacked, or caused injury to a human being or other animal. The Department will conduct a ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearing to determine whether a dog or other animal shall be declared ‘dangerous.’ 

Not all bites, attacks, or injuries warrant an animal to be declared dangerous following an administrative hearing. Under LAMC § 53.34.4(c), the Department must consider several factors:

1.	Any previous history of the animal biting, attacking, or causing injury to a person or other animal; 
2.	The nature and extent of injuries inflicted, and the number of victims involved;
3.	The place where the bite, attack, or injury occurred;
4.	The presence or absence of any provocation for the bite, attack or injury;
5.	The extent to which property has been damaged or destroyed in the incident;
6.	Whether the animal exhibits any characteristics of being trained for fighting or attack or other evidence to show such training or fighting;
7.	Whether the animal exhibits characteristics of aggressive or unpredictable temperament or behavior in the presence of human beings or other animals;
8.	Whether the animal can be effectively trained or retrained to change its temperament or behavior;
9.	The manner in which the animal had been maintained by its owner or custodian;
10.	Any other relevant evidence concerning the maintenance of the dog or other animal;
11.	Any other relevant evidence regarding the ability of the owner or custodian, or the Department, to protect the public safety in the future if the animal is permitted to remain in the City of Los Angeles.

For more information about the evidence that will be considered relating to these factors, see Evidence at ‘Potentially Dangerous Animal’ Administrative Hearings.

If, upon consideration of these factors, the Department determines the animal cannot be maintained either inside or outside the City of Los Angeles without jeopardizing public safety, the owner’s license to own animals will be revoked  and the animal will be declared dangerous and humanely destroyed. It is illegal to keep an animal after it has been declared dangerous. 

If, upon consideration of these factors, the Department determines that a bite, attack, or injury occurred but that the animal is not dangerous, the Department will either revoke the owner’s license to own animals or reissue the license subject to reasonable terms, conditions, and restrictions (TCRs) placed upon the animal’s ownership. For more information about each potential outcome, see Outcomes of ‘Potentially Dangerous Animal’ Administrative Hearings.
After an animal has been declared dangerous or an owner’s license has been revoked, the owner cannot own any animals of the same species of the animal that was the subject of the hearing in the City of Los Angeles for a period of three years. The owner’s privilege to own animals may only be reinstated within the three-year period at the discretion of the Department’s General Manager upon written request by the owner. LAMC § 53.18.5(r). 

TCRs will be issued in lieu of license revocation to the extent it is determined the owner, or any person having care, custody, or control of the animal is willing and able train, handle, or maintain the animal so that a similar incident is not likely to occur in the future. For more information about TCRs, including when TCRs may be ordered, see Terms, Conditions, and Restrictions (TCRs).

If an animal has been impounded or confined pursuant to LAMC § 53.34.2 and its license has been revoked, the owner must provide notice to the Department regarding the removal of the animal for the City of Los Angeles as required by LAMC § 53.18.5(p) before the animal will be released. Any animal impounded and not claimed within 5 days of a license revocation shall be deemed abandoned and dealt with by the Department in accordance with Chapter V, Article 3 of the LAMC.

Note, the Department strives to maintain the City of Los Angeles as a no-kill jurisdiction. The Department supports responsible animal ownership and an animal will be declared dangerous only if the Department determines the animal cannot be maintained anywhere, in any manner, to adequately protect public safety. For more information on the Department’s no-kill philosophy, see Defining No-Kill for the City of Los Angeles.

Potentially dangerous animal hearings are conducted according to the procedures stated in LAMC § 53.18.5. Read more about the procedures governing potentially dangerous animal administrative hearings at Overview of LAMC § 53.18.5 Hearing Procedures and License Revocations.

# Overview of Lamc § 53.18.5 Hearing Procedures and License Revocation

LAMC § 53.18.5 Hearing Procedures and License Revocation (link to statute)

This page outlines the procedures governing administrative hearings conducted by the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services, including ‘potentially dangerous animal’ hearings, ‘revocation of license’ hearings, and ‘barking dog noise’ hearings.

At an administrative hearing, the owner, or person having care, custody, or control, of the animal accused of biting, injuring, or attacking another human or animal is referred to as the ‘respondent.’ The person who claims they or their animal was the victim of a bite, attack, or injury is referred to as the ‘complaining witness.’ 

## Hearing Examiner

A Hearing Examiner appointed by the Department’s General Manager will preside over the hearing. LAMC § 53.34.4(b).

## Notice and subpoena power
Written notice of an administrative hearing will be sent to the respondent at least 10 days prior to the date set for the hearing. The notice requirement will be deemed to have been completed upon personal delivery of notice, posting on respondent’s property, or at the time it is mailed via U.S. Mail. LAMC § 53.18.5(c), (g). The Department may require attendance of any witnesses at hearing through subpoena. LAMC § 53.18.5(d). If you received a summons, read more about what this means for you at Why did I receive a summons?

## Continuances
The Hearing Examiner may continue a hearing if necessary upon a showing of good cause. LAMC § 53.34.4(f).

## Witnesses
At the hearing, the respondents, complaining witnesses, and the Department will have an opportunity to present evidence and call and cross-examine witnesses. LAMC § 53.34.4(e).

## Evidence and burden of proof
Administrative hearings conducted by the Department do not follow the same technical rules for evidence or witnesses as in civil or criminal court. To be considered, the evidence presented must be credible and relevant to the issues under consideration such that a reasonable person could and would rely on the evidence to make the required legal determination. Different pieces of evidence may be weighted differently in the Department’s decision based on their relevance and reliability, within the discretion of the Hearing Examiner. LAMC § 53.18.5(h).

The Department has the burden of showing that any finding or decision made by the Department is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. That is, based upon the evidence in the record for the administrative hearing, there must be a greater than 50% chance that the Department’s determination is appropriate. LAMC § 53.18.5(j).

## Reporting
The hearing will be recorded, and that recording will become part of the public record of the proceedings. LAMC § 53.18.5(i).

## Hearing Examiner report and recommendation
Within 15 days after the conclusion of the hearing, the Hearing Examiner will submit a report to the General Manager providing a summary of the evidence in the record and state the Hearing Examiners factual findings and recommendation as to the appropriate resolution of the case. That report becomes part of the public record, and the respondent will receive a copy of the report. LAMC § 53.34.4(k)-(l). For more information about the possible outcomes of a ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearing, see Outcomes of a Potentially Dangerous Animal Administrative Hearing.

Note, if the respondent fails to attend the hearing, the Hearing Examiner has discretion to continue the matter or proceed with the Hearing. The Hearing Examiner may order dismissal, revoke respondent’s license, reissue respondent’s license with terms, conditions, or restrictions, or declare an animal dangerous whether or not the respondent is present at the hearing. 

## General Manager review
The General Manager will review the Hearing Examiner’s report and will adopt, modify, or reject the Hearing Examiner’s findings, or return the matter to the Hearing Examiner for additional findings. The General Manager’s decision is final unless there is an appeal filed within 15 days. LAMC § 53.34.4(m).

## Revoked license
If a license is revoked, the animal must be surrendered to the Department or permanently removed from the City of Los Angeles, in the discretion of the Department. LAMC § 53.34.4(n).

## Notice of removal
If an animal license is revoked and the owner removes the animal from the City of Los Angeles, the owner must inform the Department in writing of the name, address, and telephone number of the new owner and the location where the animal will be kept. The old owner must notify the new owner of all complaints concerning the animal, including any TCRs imposed. LAMC § 53.18.5(p).

## Appeals
If a respondent believes the General Manager’s decision was not supported by the evidence or that the hearing was not conducted in accordance with the statutory provisions for ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearings, they may file an appeal to the Board of Animal Services Commission within 15 days after the General Manager issues the decision in the case. LAMC § 53.34.4(q). More information about the appeals process is available at ‘Potentially Dangerous Animal’ Appeal Procedures.

## Reinstatement of License Privileges
If a respondent’s license has been revoked, a respondent may request that the General Manager allow an exception so that the respondent may own other animals before the 3-year period of revocation has passed. The respondent must submit a written request to the General Manager, and whether to reinstate license privileges is within the discretion of the General Manager. LAMC § 53.34.4(r).
