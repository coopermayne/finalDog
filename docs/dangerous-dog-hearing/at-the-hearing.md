# AT THE HEARING.

This web page contains information about what to expect at a potentially dangerous animal administrative hearing so you can better understand what is going on during your hearing.
## Purpose of the hearing
A potentially dangerous animal administrative hearing is held to establish a record of facts relating to an alleged violation of the City of Los Angeles’s potentially dangerous animal statute, LAMC § 53.34.4. The purpose of this record is so that the Department can decide what outcome is necessary to protect public safety while, at the same time, seeking to promote responsible pet ownership in the City of Los Angeles. At the hearing, a Hearing Examiner will hear testimony and accept evidence relevant to the 11 statutory factors listed in LAMC § 53.34.4(c), which the Department must consider when determining the outcome of a potentially dangerous animal hearing. The Departmental (District) Representative and Hearing Examiner will use Exhibit 1 and any evidence submitted prior to the hearing as a starting point to guide the proceedings. Read more about Exhibit 1 here.

## Note regarding public hearings
Potentially dangerous animal administrative hearings conducted by the Department are public proceedings. This means that all records, including all testimony and evidence gathered before and during the hearing, are public records and can be disclosed upon request, pursuant to the California Public Records Act, Gov. Code § 6250 et seq. It also means that members from the public are welcome to attend the hearing, so long as they are not disruptive of the proceedings. 

## People at the hearing
At your hearing, several people may be present.

Be aware of the proof of identification requirements for people at the hearing. If a person at the hearing is going testify, they will have to provide proof of their identity in the form of a government approved ID (such as a driver’s license, passport, green card, etc.). Translators and attorneys will also have to present identification at the hearing. More information for translators and attorneys can be found here.

-	Departmental District Representative (District Representative) – an Animal Control Officer will represent the district within the Department of Animal Services that submitted the request for a hearing. That officer will identify the witnesses they will call and will pose questions to each witness necessary to establish a record of testimony relevant to the factors to be considered. The Animal Control Officer serving as the Department Representative for your hearing may or may not have been involved with the investigation of the matter prior to the hearing. 
-	Hearing Examiner – the Hearing Examiner appointed by the Department of Animal Services serves as a neutral arbiter presiding over the proceedings. In addition to accepting evidence, the Hearing Examiner may ask follow-up and clarifying questions after or during the District Representative’s questioning of each witness.
-	Respondent(s) – a respondent in a ‘potentially dangerous animal’ case is the owner, or any person having care, custody, and control, of the animal accused of violating the City of Los Angeles’s potentially dangerous animal statute, LAMC § 53.34.4, or who may have failed to comply with terms, conditions, and restrictions ordered at a prior hearing. 
-	Complaining Witness(es) – the complaining witness is the person who reported an incident, or incidents, that led to the District filing a request to the Hearings Division to conduct a potentially dangerous animal  hearing. The complaining witness is generally claiming they or their animal was injured, or else they are reporting an owner who they believe has violated terms and conditions ordered at a prior hearing.
-	Witness(es) – anyone other than the complaining witness and respondent who has relevant information regarding the animal or incident that is the subject of the administrative hearing may also be present to testify. Other witnesses may include (but are not limited to) someone who witnessed the alleged incident; a friend, family member, or neighbor familiar with the animal(s) or incident in question; a victim of a separate incident involving the same animal; or a person who can testify to the injury or consequences sustained as a result of the alleged incident. There may also be witnesses who have information relevant to the 11 statutory factors listed in LAMC § 53.34.4(c) used to determine the outcome of the hearing or information relevant to whether the respondent has complied with previously ordered terms and conditions. 
-	Translator(s) – hearings will be conducted in English, and if a party would feel more comfortable using a translator, they can arrange for one to be present. The translator can be a friend or family member. They should not be a party or witness at the administrative hearing or their legal representative. Their only role is to translate. Translators must be able to translate all statements as they are stated, without inserting any bias or their own additional interpretation into their translation. More information for translators is available here. 
-	Attorney(s) – any party may choose to be represented by an attorney who may be present at the hearing. Attorneys may not use the proceedings to address matters pertaining to civil litigation not handled by the Department of Animal Services, including reimbursement for alleged injuries. More information for attorneys is available here.
-	Others / Spectators – the administrative hearing is a public proceeding, and anyone else who chooses to attend may also be present at the hearing for any length of time, so long as they are not disruptive of the proceedings. 

NOTE: Anyone attending a hearing may be excused for disruptive behaviors or have their microphones muted. 

## Potentially dangerous animal hearing procedure

The hearing will proceed typically as follows:

-	Opening. The Hearing Examiner will open a hearing with a statement outlining the procedures and expectations that will be followed during the hearing. 
-	Introduction of Department’s District Representative. The District Representative will state the basis for the District’s request for a hearing. 
-	Oath. The Hearing Examiner will administer an oath to each person expecting to testify or present other evidence of any kind. Each person must agree to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth during the hearing under penalty of perjury.* 
	- Note, lying under oath in California is a felony punishable up to four years in state prison and a fine of up to $10,000. (PC § 118).
-	Evidence gathering. The District Representative will then begin questioning witnesses. If anyone has additional documentary, photo, or video evidence that was not submitted before the hearing, they may present the evidence to the Hearing Examiner during their testimony. All testimony and other evidence must be submitted under penalty of perjury.

The evidence gathering phase will go in the following order:
- Complaining witness testimony – The District Representative will begin by asking the complaining witness questions to get their testimony.
- Respondent follow-up – After the complaining witness is done with their testimony, the respondent has an opportunity to ask the complaining witness clarifying questions only. This is not the time for respondent to state their case.
- Witnesses in support of complaining witness testimony – Next, any witnesses who came to the hearing in support of the complaining witness will testify. 
- Respondent follow-up – After each witness, the respondent will have an opportunity to ask clarifying questions.
- Respondent testimony. After the complaining witness and all their supporting witnesses have testified, the District Representative will ask the respondent questions to gather their testimony.
- Complaining witness follow-up. After the respondent has testified, the complaining witness will have an opportunity to ask clarifying questions regarding that testimony.
- Witnesses in support of respondent testimony – Next, the District  Representative will question any witnesses who came to the hearing in support of the respondent. 
- Complaining witness follow-up – After each witness, the complaining witness will have an opportunity to ask clarifying questions only. This is not an opportunity to repeat or add to their testimony. 
- Hearing Examiner follow-up – after the Hearing Examiner has heard everyone’s testimony, he or she may ask for any clarifying information he or she would like to know. 
Please note that during this evidence gathering phase the hearing, either the District Representative or Hearing Examiner may ask questions at any point. 

-	Final Statements. After everyone has finished giving testimony, the respondent and complaining witness will have an opportunity to make a final statement regarding whatever they think is relevant for the outcome of the hearing. 
-	End of the hearing. Finally, the Hearing Examiner will give final remarks informing the parties of the Department’s next steps for the case and appeal procedures, and then close the hearing. After the hearing is closed, there can be no more submission of evidence on the matter. No additional evidence will be accepted or considered after this point.  

## Presenting evidence
During the hearing, parties will have an opportunity to present additional evidence for the record.

The Hearing Examiner has discretion over what evidence he or she will accept into the record at the hearing. Evidence presented at the hearing must be credible and relevant to the issues under consideration such that a reasonable person could and would rely on the evidence to make the required legal determination. Generally, the Hearing Examiner will accept any evidence that is credible and relevant to the 11 statutory factors listed in LAMC § 53.34.4(c). Written statements by parties who are not present at the hearing will generally not be accepted unless they are made under penalty of perjury, because the Hearing Examiner cannot authenticate that evidence, and other parties will not have the opportunity to challenge it. 

All parties must have an opportunity to see, challenge, or otherwise ask questions about, any evidence presented at the hearing to be included in the record. Note that introducing new evidence remotely via Zoom poses challenges best avoided by submission prior to the hearing. 

To learn more about gathering evidence for your hearing, see Preparing for a Hearing. More information about the types of evidence that may be useful at a potentially dangerous animal hearing is available at Evidence at ‘Potentially Dangerous Animal’ Administrative Hearings.

Note, the penalty for perjury in California is up to 4 years in county jail and a fine of up to $10,000. (PC § 118). The penalty for preparing and/or submitting false evidence under oath in California is up to 3 years of incarceration in state prison plus up to $10,000 in fines. (PC § 132, PC § 134). 

# Exhibit 1

You should receive a copy of Exhibit 1 along with your summons. If you did not receive a copy of Exhibit 1, contact the Hearings Division as soon as possible and they will provide one to you. You may request a copy of Exhibit 1 by emailing ani.hearings@lacity.org. In your email, you must provide your case number, which is listed in your summons. 

Exhibit 1 contains the evidence the Department gathered in its initial investigation of the complaint that led to a ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearing. The evidence in Exhibit 1 is part of the official record for the hearing. 

At the hearing, the District Representative and Hearing Examiner will ask questions about the information contained in Exhibit 1 to ‘authenticate’ the evidence in it and aid in recommending the outcome of the case. Authentication is the process of confirming where a piece of evidence comes from and that the piece of evidence is what it says it is, to ensure it is both relevant and reliable.

Exhibit 1 may also be supplemented by either party both prior to and during the administrative hearing. Evidence submitted to Exhibit 1 prior to the hearing may be submitted via email, mail, or in-person to the District that requested the administrative hearing. The requesting District is indicated in your summons via the letter code following the numeric digits in your case number. For example, WLA at the end of the fictitious case number DA 012345 WLA indicates the West Los Angeles District submitted the request for the hearing. The letter code for each District and contact information is available here. In your communications the District, you must provide your case number, which is located on your summons.

All evidence of any type submitted to LAAS before or at the hearing must be true and accurate, under penalty of perjury.

Note, the penalty for preparing and/or submitting false evidence under oath in California is a fine of up to $10,000 and up to three years in state prison. (PC § 132, PC § 134).
