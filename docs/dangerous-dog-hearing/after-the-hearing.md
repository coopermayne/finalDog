## The possible outcomes
There are four possible outcomes after a ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearing held by the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services:
1.	Dismissal
2.	Reissuance of license with terms, conditions, and restrictions (TCRs)
3.	License revocation  
4.	Animal Declared Dangerous and Destroyed

More information about what each outcome means is available at Outcomes of ‘Potentially Dangerous Animal’ Hearings.

## How the LAAS determines the outcome of the case
After the administrative hearing, the Hearing Examiner will evaluate the evidence, including oral testimony, documentary, photographic, and audio/video recorded evidence (if any), in the record in relation to the 11 statutory factors listed in LAMC § 53.34.4(c). The Hearing Examiner then sends a report to the Department’s General Manager stating his or her findings from the hearing and gives a recommendation for the appropriate outcome of the case. 

The Department’s General Manager makes the final decision as to the outcome of the case. The General Manager will review the Hearing Examiner’s report and either adopt, modify, or reject the Hearing Examiner’s recommendations. Or, the General Manager may return the matter to the Hearing Examiner to make additional recommendations or to reopen the hearing to obtain additional evidence. In any case, the General Manager makes the Department’s final decision in determining the outcome of a case.

Any finding or decision by the Department must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. That is, there must be a greater than 50% chance that, based on the evidence in the record, the determination is appropriate. More information about what evidence may be considered is available at Evidence at ‘Potentially Dangerous Animal’ Administrative Hearings.

## Notification of the outcome of the case
The General Manager for the Department of Animal Services will mail the respondent a letter stating the Department’s decision within 30 days of the administrative hearing. The General Manager’s letter will inform the respondent of the outcome of the hearing and provide instructions for how to comply with the decision in a Notice of Order.

## Compliance with each outcome

Except in cases of dismissal, the Notice of Order will inform the parties of what is required to comply with the General Manager’s decision in the case. 
-	For dismissal. A dismissal means the Hearing Examiner has determined no violation of LAMC § 53.34.4 has occurred. No further action is needed.
-	For reissuance of license with terms, conditions, and restrictions. The Notice of Order will state the conditions of animal ownership that the owner of the animal must follow in order to maintain the privilege of keeping the animal in the City of Los Angeles. More information about potential TCRs is available at Terms, Conditions and Restrictions (TCRs).
Failure to comply with the Notice of Order, or if another alleged violation of LAMC § 53.34.4, occurs, will result in another administrative hearing to determine whether the owner’s license will be revoked. It is important to comply with TCRs, or to notify the Department of your inability to comply, because the consequences at a revocation hearing for you and for an animal involved in subsequent incident may be much more severe than what was contemplated at the original administrative hearing. 
-	For license revocation. A revoked license means the respondent may not own any animals requiring a license in the City of Los Angeles for a period of 3 years from the date of revocation. This includes respondent’s animals that were not involved in the incident that was the subject of the administrative hearing. The respondent must either relinquish their animals to the Department or remove them from the City of Los Angeles, at the Department’s discretion indicated in the Notice of Order. If the Department allows for removal from the City of Los Angeles, respondent must provide verifiable information about where the animals are going, including the address and the person who will be responsible for them. Failure to remove an animal after its license has been revoked is a criminal misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1000 and/or up to 1 year in county jail. LAMC § 53.18.5(n).
Respondent may request that the General Manager allow an exception for ownership of other animals before the 3 years has passed. The respondent must submit a written request to the General Manager, and whether to reinstate license privileges is within the discretion of the General Manager. LAMC § 53.18.5(r).
-	Animal declared dangerous and destroyed. If not already impounded by the Department, an animal that is declared dangerous must immediately be surrendered to the Department. More information regarding appeals is available at Department of Animal Services Appeal Procedures. It is illegal to keep any animal declared to be dangerous. LAMC § 53.34.4(d).

NOTE: the complaining witness has the right to report to the District if they see that instructions provided in the Notice of Order are not being followed, and the District will determine whether another administrative hearing is necessary. However, your right to report violations DOES NOT give you the right to obtain evidence of a violation illegally. Complaints based on evidence obtained through trespassing, harassment, or other improper means will not be tolerated.

## Possibilities for appeal

There are two ways in which the General Manager’s decision can be appealed: (1) appeal to the Board of Animal Services Commission, LAMC § 53.18.5(q)1-3; and (2) file a writ of mandate to the Los Angeles Superior Court, CCP § 1094.6(a). Below, see instructions for how to pursue each:

### Appeal to the Board of Animal Services Commission (“the Board”)

So long as the respondent attended the administrative hearing, the respondent may appeal the General Manager’s decision to the Board. Only the respondent may appeal to the Board. If a respondent wishes to appeal the outcome of a hearing, he or she must mail or file the appeal postmarked no more than 15 days after the date listed in the General Manager’s letter that notified the respondent of the outcome of the hearing. A respondent must go through an appeal to the Board before seeking a writ of mandate.
Appeals must be made in writing using the LAAS Appeal Request Form. If the case was not dismissed and the respondent attended the hearing, the respondent will receive the Appeal Request form along with the General Manager’s letter; it is also available here. On the form, the respondent must state the specific reasons why he or she believes the Department’s decision is not supported by the evidence in the record or why the hearing was not conducted in accordance with the procedures laid out by LAMC § 53.18.5 (see LAMC § 53.18.5(q)3).
Appeals may be filed with or mailed to:
Board of Animal Services Commissioners
221 North Figueroa Street, Suite 600
Los Angeles, CA 90012
LAAS appeal procedures are governed by LAMC § 54.18.5(q). Read more about how the Department decides an appeal at ‘Potentially Dangerous Animal’ Appeal Procedures.
NOTE: a respondent must comply with the Department’s decision while an appeal is pending.

### File a writ of mandate to the Los Angeles Superior Court

Under the California Code of Civil Procedure, a party may file a writ of mandate with the Los Angeles Superior Court to obtain judicial review of the case in Superior Court. CCP § 1094.6(a). The respondent may only file a writ of mandate after all appeals to the Board are exhausted. 
A complaining witness may also file a writ of mandate if they are able to assert a ‘beneficial interest’ in the outcome of the administrative hearing. CCP § 1086. A complaining witness may have a ‘beneficial private interest’ if they can show the General Manager’s decision caused them to suffer a practical harm that is over-and-above the effect to the general public, or a ‘beneficial public interest’ if the matter concerns a public right and the mandamus petition is to procure the enforcement of a public duty.

Filing a writ of mandate is complicated, so it is recommended that a party seeking a writ of mandate consult with an attorney.
Under a writ of mandate, the court, without a jury, will consider whether the Department had jurisdiction in the case and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. It is an abuse of discretion where the Department did not conduct the administrative hearing in a manner required by law, under LAMC § 53.18.5, the General Manager’s decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence. CCP § 1094.5(b).

NOTE: a party filing for a writ of mandate may be responsible for paying some of the costs associated with a proceeding held under a writ of mandate. CCP § 1094.5(a).
	Please NOTE also: Unless and until a writ of mandate is granted by the Court, respondent 	must comply with the General Manager’s decision.

## ‘Potentially Dangerous Animal’ Appeal Procedure

LAMC § 53.18.5(q) provides the rules for appeal of ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearings.
Appeals of the result of a ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearing are made to the Board of Animal Services Commissioners (“the Board”). A respondent may appeal the General Manager’s decision only if the respondent attended the hearing. Neither the person claiming injury to themself or their animal nor any other witness may file an appeal to the Board.

Appeals must be submitted in writing using an LAAS Appeal Request Form. The Department will include a copy of the Appeal Request Form with the letter giving the General Manager’s decision, and it is also available here. On the form, the respondent (“appellant”) must explain specifically why he or she believes (1) the General Manager’s decision was not supported by the evidence; or (2) the hearing was not conducted in accordance with the rules governing ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearings outlined in LAMC § 53.18.5. The Board will not consider any other reasons for appeal. Note, an appellant must comply with the General Manager’s decision while an appeal is pending.

Appeals must be filed or postmarked no later than the date listed as the deadline for appeal in the General Manger’s letter. That is, an appeal must be filed or postmarked no later than 15 days after the General Manager issues their decision. Appeals may be mailed or submitted in person to:

**Board of Animal Services Commissioners** <br />
221 North Figueroa Street, Suite 600
Los Angeles, CA 90012

The General Manager will provide the appeal materials to the Board within 10 days of receiving it. 
After an appeal is filed, the Board will hold a hearing to review the appeal, after which it will either affirm, modify, or reverse the General Manager’s decision. At the hearing, the Board will not consider new evidence on appeal. It will only base its decision upon
-	The record before the Hearing Examiner;
-	The Hearing Examiner’s report;
-	The General Manager’s written decision;
-	The appeal form; and
-	A consideration of statements, if any, presented to the Board orally or in writing at the hearing.

After the hearing, the Board will either affirm, modify, or reverse the General Manager’s decision. The Board must issue its decision within 75 days after it receives the appeal materials from the General Manager. The time period for a decision may only be extended up to an additional 15 days if the appellant, General Manager, and Board all agree. LAMC § 53.18.5(q)7.

The Board will only grant an appeal when the General Manager’s decision is not supported by the evidence, or when the administrative hearing was not conducted in accordance with the procedures laid out in LAMC § 53.18.5.

If an animal has been declared dangerous and ordered destroyed following a ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearing, the General Manager will not authorize its destruction until after all appeals are complete. LAMC § 53.34.4(d)3. A decision of the Board is final. If the respondent disagrees with the Board’s decision, they may appeal to the Los Angeles Superior Court via a writ of mandate. CCP § 1094.5. Filing a writ of mandate can be complicated, so it is recommended a party consult with a lawyer.
