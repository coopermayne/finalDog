If a dog or other animal is accused of biting, attacking, or injuring a person or other animal, an Animal Control Officer from the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services (“LAAS” or “the Department”) will investigate the complaint, and the Department will decide whether there is enough evidence that a ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearing is necessary to determine whether the animal shall be declared ‘dangerous’ and subject to consequences. A ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearing is a formal legal process that allows the Department to effectively and fairly gather evidence to understand if an animal poses any risk to public safety, and if so, the best way to address that risk. 

Los Angeles Municipal Code (“LAMC”) [§ 53.18.5]() and [§ 53.34.4]() authorize the Department to conduct potentially dangerous animal administrative hearings. Read more about each statute at the links below:
