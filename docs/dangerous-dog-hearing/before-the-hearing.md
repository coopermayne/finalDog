# Why Did I Receive a Summons?
You received a summons because the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services (“LAAS” or “the Department”) has enough evidence to conduct a hearing about whether an animal or the circumstances of that animal’s ownership may pose an unreasonable risk to public safety. The Department may have decided that there is enough evidence to conduct a hearing to decide whether an animal has violated the City of Los Angeles’s ‘dangerous animal’ statute, LAMC § 53.34.4.  Or the issue at the hearing may be whether an owner is in violation of terms, conditions, and restrictions ordered at a previous administrative hearing. The purpose of the hearing is to consider all the relevant evidence to determine what is necessary to further responsible pet ownership while reducing risks to public health and safety. 

You are being summoned to attend the hearing because the Department has identified you as a possible victim of a specific incident, a witness to an incident, or the owner (known as a respondent) of an animal that may have been involved in a specific incident in which an injury to a human or another animal may have occurred. 
This web page contains information so you can better understand what it means for you to have received a summons to attend a ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearing. For information focused on helping you prepare for your hearing, see Preparing for a Hearing.

## LAAS procedure for resolving potentially dangerous animal complaints. Potentially dangerous animal complaints are resolved according to the procedure laid out in LAMC § 53.18.5:
1.	The Department of Animal Services learns of a possible violation of LAMC § 53.34.4 (dangerous animal statute) and initiates an investigation, or a complaining witness files a complaint to an LAAS Animal Care and Control Center alleging an animal has violated LAMC § 53.34.4;
2.	LAAS Animal Control Officers investigate the complaint.
3.	If there is evidence of a violation, the District that received the initial complaint requests a “potentially dangerous animal administrative hearing.” 
4.	The Hearings Division of LAAS reviews the request. When the Hearings Division decides there is a sufficient basis for a hearing, the Hearings Division issues a summons to parties it believes may have relevant information to aid the Department in determining what happened and what should be done to protect public safety, if anything. 
5.	Anyone who says a particular animal harmed them or their animal(s) (complaining witness) and, also, the animal owner (respondent) prepare for the hearing and submit evidence to the District that received the initial complaint Learn about how to effectively prepare for your hearing at by exploring Preparing for a Hearing. For information directed at the type of evidence considered, see Evidence at Potentially Dangerous Animal Administrative Hearings.
6.	The Department holds ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearings in accordance with the procedures in LAMC § 53.18.5. Learn more about what happens during a hearing at the At the Hearing section of this website.
7.	Within 15 days after the hearing, the Hearing Examiner submits a report to the LAAS General Manager stating his or her findings and recommendations about the complaint and what the appropriate outcome should be.
8.	Within approximately 15 days after receipt of the report, the General Manager reviews the report and issues a Letter of Determination stating the Department’s ultimate decision, either adopting, modifying, or rejecting the Hearing Examiner’s recommendation. This letter will contain a Notice of Order, if the case has not been dismissed.
9.	Unless the respondent files an appeal with the Department within 15 days after the General Manager issues the Notice of Order, the Department’s decision is final. Read more about eligibility to appeal, rules for obtaining an appeal, and appellate procedures at ‘Potentially Dangerous Animal’ Appeal Procedures.

## Purpose of ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearings 
‘Potentially dangerous animal’ hearings are held to determine whether an animal accused of violating LAMC § 53.34.4 poses an unreasonable risk of public safety. The administrative hearing is meant to establish a record of facts relating to the alleged violation to aid the Department in determining what outcome is necessary to protect public safety while, at the same time, seeking to promote responsible pet ownership in the City of Los Angeles. 

## More information about LAAS administrative hearings 
An administrative hearing is a formal legal proceeding which can result in legal consequences. Administrative hearings held by LAAS operate kind of like being in court for a trial. However administrative hearings involve disputes under the authority of a governmental agency, in this case LAAS, rather than civil or criminal matters.- Hearings are open to the public, but members of the public do not participate. There is no jury.
The parties to an LAAS hearing are the complainant and respondent rather than plaintiff and defendant. At a hearing, the Department, specifically the District that received the initial complaint, is the “complainant,” and the owner having care, custody, or control over the animal in question is the “respondent.” The person who claims to have been harmed or that their animal has been harmed is the “complaining witness.” The respondent and complaining witness are summoned to provide evidence under oath at the hearing. 
The hearing is conducted by a Hearing Examiner appointed by the General Manager of LAAS. At the hearing, the Hearing Examiner hears testimony and gathers evidence submitted under oath that the Hearing Examiner will consider when formulating their recommendation to the General Manager as to the proper resolution of the case. The Hearing Examiner relies on several factors set out by statute in LAMC § 53.34.4(c) in making their determination. 

Note, while LAAS ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearings do not involve civil or criminal charges, the circumstances underlying the dispute may independently give rise to a civil lawsuit, and in extreme circumstances the Hearing Examiner may recommend criminal charges to prosecuting authorities. LAAS does not handle claims for reimbursement or compensation for damage or costs that may have been caused by respondent or respondent’s animal(s).

## Exhibit 1

Exhibit 1 contains the evidence the Department has gathered in its initial investigation of the complaint that led to the hearing. The evidence contained in Exhibit 1 is part of the official record for the hearing. The Hearing Examiner will ask about the information contained in Exhibit 1 during the hearing to aid in recommending the outcome of the case. Exhibit 1 may also be supplemented by either party both prior to and during the administrative hearing. All evidence of any type submitted to LAAS before or at the hearing must be true and accurate, under penalty of perjury.- 
Along with your summons, you should have received a copy of Exhibit 1. If you did not receive a copy of Exhibit 1, contact the Hearings Division as soon as possible and they will provide one to you. You may request a copy of Exhibit 1 by emailing ani.hearings@lacity.org. When you contact the District, you must provide the case number, which appears on your summons.

Note, the penalty for perjury in California is up to four years in county jail and a fine of up to $10,000. (PC § 118). The penalty for preparing and/or submitting false evidence under oath in California is up to three years of incarceration in state prison plus up to $10,000 in fines. (PC § 132, PC § 134). 

## Expectations for attendance
Because you received a summons, you are responsible for attending the hearing at the date and time listed in the summons. If there is some reason you cannot attend the hearing, alert the LAAS Hearings Division as soon as possible. Your attendance is important to the Department’s ability to come to the appropriate resolution in your case. Failing to attend has multiple consequences for all parties involved. 

- **For respondent**: If you do not attend the hearing, you lose your right to appeal the Department’s determination in your case. You also forfeit your opportunity to testify on the record to give your side of the story, which would help the Hearing Examiner identify the appropriate resolution for your case. This often leads to a worse outcome from the hearing than if you had attended it. Particularly, if you do not attend the hearing, the Hearing Examiner cannot show in their report that you would be willing to comply with terms and conditions. Accordingly, your license to own a particular animal could be revoked. If that happens, you will be prohibited from owning any dog in the City of Los Angeles for three years. See Outcomes of Potentially Dangerous Animal Administrative Hearings to learn more about the possible outcomes.
- **For person claiming injury to self or their animals (complaining witness)**: If you do not attend the hearing, the Department may dismiss your case if there is not enough evidence to support the allegations in your initial complaint. There may be sufficient admissible evidence in the file, but, if not, your failure to attend will result in dismissal of the case. The hearing is your best opportunity to explain what happened and what you think the appropriate resolution should be.  
- **For other witnesses to an alleged incident**: If relevant and reliable, your testimony provides information that may help the Hearing Examiner determine what happened and what the appropriate outcome should be. It is important that you attend to allow the Department to get the fullest picture of what happened so the Department may determine what the appropriate outcome should be. Witness statements by persons not in attendance at the hearing generally cannot be afforded any weight in the Hearing Examiner’s recommendation unless they are made under penalty of perjury. A written or video recorded statement may be considered if submitted under penalty of perjury. Please see Evidence at ‘Potentially Dangerous Animal’ Administrative Hearings’ for more information about how to submit relevant evidence under penalty of perjury.
Again, if you cannot attend the hearing at the date and time listed, or if you have concerns about your ability to access the hearing remotely via Zoom, contact the Department’s Hearings Division as soon as possible. Send an email to ani.hearings@lacity.org  or call (213) 482-7435 to let them know if you are unable to attend your hearing and the Hearings Division will determine if there is good cause to reschedule. You must provide the case number, which appears on your summons. Hearings will not be rescheduled after the hearing has been closed by the Hearing Examiner.

## Possible outcomes following the administrative hearing
Because the Department requested an administrative hearing, that means the Department has determined there is some evidence a violation of LAMC § 53.34.4 has occurred. After the hearing, the Hearing Examiner will consider the evidence gathered in the Department’s preliminary investigation of the complaint (contained in Exhibit 1 and any addenda-) and introduced at the administrative hearing, and will recommend one of four possible outcomes:

1.	Dismissal;
2.	Reissuance of respondent’s license with terms, conditions, and restrictions; 
3.	Revocation of respondent’s license;
4.	Declaration that animal is ‘dangerous’ and humane destruction. 

See LAMC § 53.34.4(d)-(e).

Upon consideration of the Hearing Examiner’s findings, the General Manager will either adopt, modify, or reject the Hearing Examiner’s recommendation and decide the ultimate result of the administrative hearing. Failure to comply with an outcome may result in criminal charges. For more information on each of the four possible outcomes, see Outcomes of ‘Potentially Dangerous Animal’ Administrative Hearings. 

- Note: parties can submit relevant evidence, under oath, to the District up to XXXX days before the hearing. This will be submitted to the Hearings Division as an “Addendum” to Exhibit 1. If you have additional evidence to submit, you should submit it to the Field Supervisor of the District that filed the request for the hearing. If you do not already have that contact information, email ani.hearings@lacity.org and they will direct you to the proper District to which you can submit your evidence. When you contact the District, you must provide the case number, which appears on your summons.

## Next steps

Prepare for your hearing! The outcome of a ‘potentially dangerous animal’ administrative hearing is legally binding and there are limited opportunities for appeal, so it is important that all parties are adequately prepared for the hearing. Make sure you understand the procedures the Department uses to determine the outcome of a potentially dangerous animal administrative hearing (LAMC § 53.18.5), and learn what you can do to provide evidence to support your perspective about what happened during a specific incident. 

More information on how to prepare is included in the Preparing for a Hearing and Evidence at ‘Potentially Dangerous Animal’ Hearings sections of this website. You may also choose to consult a lawyer, although that is not required. Please bear in mind that, if you do not consult with an attorney, and you as the respondent receive an undesired outcome in the case, there are limited grounds for appeal. For instance, you may not submit new evidence as part of your appeal.

# Possible Outcomes

There Are Four Possible Outcomes Following a “potentially Dangerous Animal” Administrative Hearing: 
1. Dismissal
2. License Reissued With Terms, Conditions, and Restrictions
3. License Revoked
4. Animal Declared Dangerous and Destroyed

The General Manager Will Order Whatever Outcome the Department Determines Is Necessary in Order to Reasonably Protect Public Safety. The Owner, or Any Person Having Care, Custody, or Control, of the Animal Accused of Violating the Statute (Respondent) Must Comply With the Outcome of the Hearing, or Else Face Additional Consequences. 

## Dismissal
The General Manager Will Order a Dismissal if It Is Determined There Is Not Enough Evidence to Show That a Bite, Attack, or Injury Occurred.  the Case May Also Be Dismissed Where a Bite, Attack, or Injury Did Occur, but It Is Determined the Animal Does Not Pose a Risk to Public Safety.
In Either Case, the Department Has Determined Neither the Animal Nor the Circumstances of the Animal’s Care Pose a Risk to Public Safety, So No Further Action Is Needed to Protect Public Safety.

## Animal License Reissued With Terms, Conditions, and Restrictions
The Respondent’s Animal License Will Be Reissued Subject to Terms, Conditions, and Restrictions (Tcrs), if the Evidence Shows That a Bite, Attack, or Injury Occurred, but That the Severity of the Incident Does Not Warrant Declaring the Animal Dangerous, and That Reasonable Terms, Conditions, and Restrictions Placed Upon the Respondent’s Ownership of the Animal Will Eliminate the Risk to Public Safety. Tcrs Are Conditions of Animal Ownership Placed on a License and Are Intended to Prevent the Recurrence of the Circumstances That Led to an Incident Resulting in an Administrative Hearing. Thus, With the Ordered Tcrs in Place, There Is No Further Risk to Public Safety. The Department Has Authority to Issue Tcrs Under Lamc § 53.34.4(e)1 and § 53.18.5(l)1.
Anyone Having Care, Custody, or Control of an Animal Whose License Is Subject to Tcrs, Including the Respondent and Any Subsequent Owner of the Animal, Must Abide by All Tcrs Imposed for as Long as the Animal Is Alive, or for as Long as the Animal Is Kept Within the City of Los Angeles.
Commonly Ordered Tcrs Include, but Are Not Limited To: 
- Obtaining Professional Training for Both the Dog and Owner in Order to Correct the Dog’s Identified Behavioral Problems;
- Preventing the Animal FROM Accessing Certain Portions of the Respondent’s Property;
- Installing Locking Mechanisms on Access Points to the Respondent’s Property;
- Having Animal Spayed or Neutered, Even if Otherwise Exempt.
Respondents Must Demonstrate That They Are Willing and Able to Comply With Reasonable Tcrs at the Administrative Hearing. Note, Tcrs May Also Include Verification Procedures by the Department to Ensure Compliance. Failure to Comply With Tcrs Will Result in a Subsequent Administrative Hearing for Revocation of the Owner’s License. Lamc § 53.18.5(l)2.
For More Information on Potential Tcrs, See Terms, Conditions, and Restrictions (Tcrs). 

## Animal License Revoked
The General Manager Will Revoke the Respondent’s License for Animal Ownership if the Evidence Shows That a Bite, Attack, or Injury Did Occur but That the Severity of the Incident Does Not Warrant Declaring the Animal Dangerous, and That the Respondent Is Unwilling or Unable to Take Protective Measures (In the Form of Tcrs) That Will Eliminate the Risk to Public Safety in the Future. The Department Has the Authority to Revoke a Respondent’s License Under Lamc § 53.34.4(e)1.
Under Lamc § 53.28, All Dogs Owned Within the City of Los Angeles Over the Age of Four Months Must Be Licensed. A Revoked License Means the Respondent May Not Own Any Animals Requiring a License in the City of Los Angeles for a Period of 3 Years FROM the Date of Revocation. Lamc § 53.34.4(h). This Includes Respondent’s Animals That Were Not Involved in the Incident That Was the Subject of the Administrative Hearing. Upon Revocation, the Respondent Will Receive an Order to Either PROMptly and Permanently Remove Their Animals FROM the City of Los Angeles or to Relinquish Their Animals to the Department. Generally, the Respondent Must Comply Within 5 Days of the Department’s Decision. Lamc § 53.18.5(n).
Failure to Remove or Relinquish an Animal After Its License Has Been Revoked Is a Criminal Misdemeanor Punishable by a Fine of Up to $1000 And/or Up to 1 Year in County Jail. Lamc § 53.18.5(n).
After a License Is Revoked, the Privilege to Own Other Animals, Including the Respondents’ Privilege to Continue to Own Their Animals Not the Subject of the Administrative Hearing, May Only Be Reinstated Within the 3-Year Period of Revocation Upon a Written Request to the General Manager, Submitted by the Owner. The Department May Issue a New License, Subject to the General Manager’s Discretion. If the General Manager Chooses to Reissue a New License, He or She May Issue the License Subject to Any Tcrs He or She Believes Are Necessary to Protect Public Safety. Lamc § 53.18.5(r) Gives the General Manager Authority to Reinstate License Privileges. 

## Animal Declared Dangerous and Destroyed
An Animal Will Be Declared ‘Dangerous’ if the Evidence Shows That a Bite, Attack, or Injury Occurred and the Circumstances Are So Severe That the Department Believes the Animal Cannot Be Maintained Safely Either Inside or Outside of the City of Los Angeles Without Being an Unreasonable Threat to Public Safety. Any Animal Declared Dangerous Will Be Humanely Destroyed. Lamc § 53.34.4(d)2. 

An Animal That Is Declared Dangerous, if Not Already Impounded by the Department, Must Immediately Be Surrendered to the Department. Under Lamc § 53.34.4(d)3, the General Manager Will Not Authorize the Animal to Be Destroyed Until After the Period for Appeal Has Closed, 15 Days After the Date Listed in the General Manager’s Letter Informing the Parties of the Department’s Disposition in the Case, or if an Appeal Is Filed, 5 Days After Service of the Board of Animal Services Commission’s Decision. 

It Is Illegal to Keep Any Animal After It Has Been Declared to Be Dangerous. Lamc § 53.34.4(d)1. Any Person Who Owns or Who Otherwise Has Custody, Care, and Control Over an Animal Declared to Be Dangerous May Be Convicted of a Criminal Misdemeanor or Felony if That Animal Injures Another Person. Pc § 399. A Misdemeanor Carries a Penalty of Up to 1 Year in County Jail And/or Up to a $1000 Fine, and a Felony Conviction Carries a Penalty of Up to 3 Years in Jail And/or Up to $10,000 in Fines. 

Declaring an Animal Dangerous Is a Rare Outcome and Only Occurs in the Most Extreme Circumstances. The Department Believes in Facilitating Responsible Animal Ownership, and This Outcome Occurs Only if Other Possible Avenues Are Foreclosed by a Determination That the Animal Cannot Be Safely Maintained Anywhere. The Department Strives to Maintain the City of Los Angeles as a No-Kill Jurisdiction. For More Information on the Department’s No-Kill Philosophy, See Defining No-Kill for the City of Los Angeles.
