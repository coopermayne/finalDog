## LAAS

The Los Angeles Department of Animal Services Hearings Division handles complaints regarding potentially dangerous animals and excessive dog barking. 
Different laws govern each of these different types of complaints. For the law governing potentially dangerous animals, see Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) [ยง 53.34.4](). 
For the law governing barking dog noise, see LAMC [ยง 53.63](). The Department often conducts administrative hearings to resolve these complaints. The procedure for conducting 
administrative hearings for both potentially dangerous animal and barking dog noise complaints is governed by LAMC [ยง 53.18.5](). 

This website is a collaborative project between the UCLA Law Dog Administrative Hearings Clinic and the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services. Continuing into this 
site will give you more information on the administrative hearings conducted by the Department to resolve these complaints.
